**Hello** _world_.

This is **_markdown_**

[ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com) is a really useful tool. I also use [Google](https://google.com) to find things.

# Table in Markdown

## This is a level 2 header

Name            | Age     | Height     | Superpower
---             |---      |---         |---

Ubial           |pretty old       |4'11        |good teacher

To make a list we use the following:

* This is the first item in the list
* This is the second
    * This is actually a subpoint in this list

- This is also a list
- You can use these as bullets as well
    - You can also use sublists with dashes

1. This is the first in an ordered list
2. This is the second
    1. This is a sublist
    2. Another item
        - This is unordered
        - Same here

    # Blockquote

    These are usually used to show quotes, things people have said
